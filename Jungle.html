	<p style="font-size: 25px">The jungle of Augglandia is one of the most beautful parts of the island. Though it is not a tourist spot. Most of the visitors are young adults, who come and stay in hostels, and go on hikes through the jungle.

	The jungle sees roughly 450,000 visitors per year. The average age is around 26. The jungle is one of the only nationaly protected parts of the island, so no roads or houses are built there.
